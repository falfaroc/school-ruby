    Completed Step 1. Created the necessary files; Gemfile, beancounting.rb, bean_testing.rb,
    acm00.feature and modified env.rb to link to the correct file. Also, in the testing
    I created an input and output as specified in the question.
    
    Have not considered how the input is going to be handled as of right now but I
    believe the base work is done for input and output.

    Completed the final step (step 3) of r010. This was converting the string into
    an integer array so that we can compare the result of the function with what
    we expect.
    
    Ran into the issue of the first element resulting 0 while the rest were fine.
    I solved this by stripping the quotations from the string and then converting
    that into an integer array. It appeared that Ruby would escape the first quotation
    which then when attempting to split the string, the quotation would try to convert to
    an integer and thus resulting it to 0.

    Created a prime_testing.rb that handles the step_definitions for the tests.
    Also, modified the testing so that it is done by a table instead of the
    original tedious way.
    
    Need to handle the array return so that it is split into an int array
    instead of a string.

    Downloaded prime_factors.rb, initialized the required files for cucumber and
    copied over the prime.feature file to the correct location.
    
    Ran into the issue of cucumber displaying a parser error. Turns out that if
    the keyword 'Feature' begins with a lowercase 'f', cucumber is not able to
    detect the tests.

    Figured out why cucumber was not detecting the features file. Turns out that before
    each test you need the 'Scenario:' key word for cucumber to detect it. Without that key
    word, cucumber just displays 0 scenarios, 0 steps.
    
    Next I will be fixing up the scenarios to pass its given steps.

    When I attempted to run cucumber, it did not throw any errors or warnings even though
    the instructions said it would. Need to look into why it is not throwing any issues.

    Ran into the obstacle of understanding how rspec handles the expects for stdout. There
    are many different ways to handled and similar to the stdin, all my previous attempts
    failed. Luckily a post on reformatcode.com had a very simple solution that is also
    displayed by Tommaso Pavese.

    Ran into the issue of not handling stdout properly and test would just break because it would skip

    Now that I am able to send in stdin data in rspec, I can proceed to attempt to check stdout
    in a similar fashion.
    
    I got stuck for a bit trying to send in stdin data to the program. There are many different ways that
    are shown online and in the examples that I kept trying all of them and none of them seem to work.
    Luckily the one example shown by Tommasa Pavese worked and fulfulled the sending of stdin
    without modifying the nim.rb code.

    At this point the test cases are trial and error because the mutant results can be

    Added two new test cases;
    1) The input array is inverted and only sorts the last few elements. This results in
    the algorithm choosing a middle pivot point.
    2) The insertionSort function takes an array and only sorts the first couple elements.
    These two cases resulted in lowering the alive count from 39 to 37. Will attempt to see
    if I can resolve anymore mutants.
    At this point it is difficult to come up with test cases that lower the alive count much.

    At the start was not able to lower alive count more, but just kept trying different cases until it

    Solved the many of the UtilityFunction warnings from reek by splitting up the classes
    and creating instance variables to handle them.
    Simplecov still covers 100% of the code. Rspec successfully passes all 4 test and
    there are no longer any reek errors.

    Went from 9 reek warnings to 4 reek warnings. Currently, rspec is failing on the final
    test because I am moving and fixing the code to satisfy reek.
    Most of the reek warnings were fixed by moving and splitting up code to satisfy
    TooManyParameters or NestedLoops.

    Set up Mac to run reek, rspec and bundle. Realized that developing on a Windows machine
    is too complicated and it doesn't have the same capabilities as Unix/Linux system.
    For example, Windows doesn't have 'make' so that hinders any development.

    Fixed the following reek warnings; TooManyStatements, InstanceVariableAssumption, TooManyInstanceVariables, and IrresponsibleModule.
    TooManyStatements in the following methods; solved_without_matrix? solved? and build_blocks. Fixed by splitting up functions into smaller functions.
    InstanceVariableAssumption ficed by moving those variables into the initialize function of the module.
    TooManyInstanceVariables fixed by using less of them. Reek only allows 5 instance variables.
    IrresponsibleModule fixed by adding descriptions to the module and class.

    Complete steps three, four and five. Understanding the tasks is a bit
    challenging, better clarity would be ideal.

    Completed Step two from the list. Installing reek on windows took a bit longer
    because 'gem install reek' did not work so I had to go and download the
    missing dependancies. After I had reek installed, figuring out the different errors
    and looking up how to fix them took sometime.

    Began by testing the magic_ball exampleto ensure that minitest works correctly.
    After seeing minitest work, I moved count_down to this directory and began modifying
    it to complete step one.
    
    Within the 30 minutes, I was able to complete Step one. Reading the different assertions
    took a bit to figure out which assertion is best.
