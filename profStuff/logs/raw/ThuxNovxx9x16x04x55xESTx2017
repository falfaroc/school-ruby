    Continue to work on mutant warnings. Added test cases for lo > hi, hi out of range and nil input.
    Also, change more array access to be called by .fetch. All this resulted in the alive mutants to
    lower to 41 alive.

    Contiune to solve mutant warnings. Lowered the count of alive mutatnts to 58 and increased the coverage to 90.76%.
    Instead of accessing the array using [], the .fetch resolved many of the warnings. Also added a raise_error when
    the hi index is greater than the length of the array.

    Completed step 2. Created 2 new test cases to achieve 100% code coverage.
    One test case ensured that the pivot element in the quicksort would be the middle element.
    The second test case paritions the array if there are more than 20 elements in it.

    Completed Step 4. Ensured that reek does not give any warnings and simplecov
    still reports 100% line coverage. By splitting up the large function 'shift_down',
    I was able to fix the last warning by reek; TooManyStatements.

    Started with 9 reek warnings and now I am down to one which is a TooManyStatements.
    Similar to previous tasks, most warnings got solved by splitting large functions
    into smaller simple functions. Also, changing the input atttribute to reader and
    added a comment describing what the class does.
    Finishing Step 4 by splitting up the final large function.

    Completed Steps 2 and 3. The given example from step 2 covers all but 1 line

    Moving to step 4 to solve all reek warnings.

    Split up the master class of board into two more classes 'WithMatrix' and 'NoMatrix'.
    Both these new classes inherit from 'Board' but now it is easier to keep track which
    type of sudoku solution we are using.
    Solved the many of the UtilityFunction warnings from reek by splitting up the classes
    and creating instance variables to handle them.
    Simplecov still covers 100% of the code. Rspec successfully passes all 4 test and
    there are no longer any reek errors.

    Went from 9 reek warnings to 4 reek warnings. Currently, rspec is failing on the final
    test because I am moving and fixing the code to satisfy reek.
    Most of the reek warnings were fixed by moving and splitting up code to satisfy
    TooManyParameters or NestedLoops.

    Fixed the following reek warnings; TooManyStatements, InstanceVariableAssumption, TooManyInstanceVariables, and IrresponsibleModule.
    TooManyStatements in the following methods; solved_without_matrix? solved? and build_blocks. Fixed by splitting up functions into smaller functions.
    InstanceVariableAssumption ficed by moving those variables into the initialize function of the module.
    TooManyInstanceVariables fixed by using less of them. Reek only allows 5 instance variables.
    IrresponsibleModule fixed by adding descriptions to the module and class.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Fixed all the warnings thrown by reek. Seperated the multiple method calls
    into their own functions.
    Basically, once the core logic was ironed out, all the test cases ran and
    passed.
    
    Task is done, might continue to clean up code. Will work and try to finish
    previous steps in r001.

Date:   Tue Oct 3 10:50:03 2017 -0400

    RPT: r002 20
    
    Modified program to pass all the test cases. Incorrect calculation being
    done.
    
    Learned what attr_reader does and helps so that I do not have to implement
    that function.
    
    Going to run reek and begin fixing the code smell throughout the program.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Solved why certain variables were being overwritten. Learned the difference
    between global variables and instance variables. Modified the hash table
    that keeps track of the BasePrice class and Discount class.
    
    Need to run reek on the modified code to ensure there is no code smell.
    Fixing those will take sometime.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Fixed the attribute issue between objects. Created a hash that will count
    the number of each item inputted.
    
    Calculating the correct total value is next.
    
    Learning about hash and working with them took a bit of time.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Modified the hash table to be a nested hash table so it handles the
    discounts differently. Created a Discount class for the specific
    discount per item.
    
    Looking into why my totals variable does not reset on object initialization.
    Next, modifying the totals calculation.

    RPT: r002 25
    
    Reading the requirements for r002. Setting up checkout.rb and checkout_test.rb.
    Resolving the two errors so they are only warnings now. Running reek on checkout.rb
    and ensuring that there is no code smell.
    
    Since we are not modifying checkout_test.rb, not resolving the code smell pointed
    out by reek. Working on setting the rules.

    Did not fully complete step 9. Created the new methods but not working
    correctly. Running into assertion issues and bad comparison.
    
    Description of the task unclear. What does time_log return, time sent by
    print or time calculated by Time.now? Also, messages seperated by 1 second
    when 60 second intervals has been done in the past.

    RPT: r001 30
    
    Complete steps six, seven, eight. This consists of creating the timeInterval
    method which throws an UncommunicativeMethodName warning by reek. Splitting
    the one file to three different files and creating the log array.
    
    One issue that I kept dealing with is the warnings thrown by reek. Many
    I can solve by reading the documentation but some are very ambiguous such as,
    UtilityFunction.

    Completed Step two from the list. Installing reek on windows took a bit longer
    because 'gem install reek' did not work so I had to go and download the
    missing dependancies. After I had reek installed, figuring out the different errors
    and looking up how to fix them took sometime.

    Began by testing the magic_ball exampleto ensure that minitest works correctly.
    After seeing minitest work, I moved count_down to this directory and began modifying
    it to complete step one.
    
    Within the 30 minutes, I was able to complete Step one. Reading the different assertions
    took a bit to figure out which assertion is best.
