    Modified the variables in the print class to be instance
    variables and that fixed many of the incorrect value issues.
    
    No problems completing step 9 after fixing the statement above.

    Fixed all the warnings thrown by reek. Seperated the multiple method calls
    into their own functions.
    Basically, once the core logic was ironed out, all the test cases ran and
    passed.
    
    Task is done, might continue to clean up code. Will work and try to finish
    previous steps in r001.

    RPT: r002 20
    
    Modified program to pass all the test cases. Incorrect calculation being
    done.
    
    Learned what attr_reader does and helps so that I do not have to implement
    that function.
    
    Going to run reek and begin fixing the code smell throughout the program.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Solved why certain variables were being overwritten. Learned the difference
    between global variables and instance variables. Modified the hash table
    that keeps track of the BasePrice class and Discount class.
    
    Need to run reek on the modified code to ensure there is no code smell.
    Fixing those will take sometime.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Fixed the attribute issue between objects. Created a hash that will count
    the number of each item inputted.
    
    Calculating the correct total value is next.
    
    Learning about hash and working with them took a bit of time.

    RPT: r002 30
    
    Modified the hash table to be a nested hash table so it handles the
    discounts differently. Created a Discount class for the specific
    discount per item.
    
    Looking into why my totals variable does not reset on object initialization.
    Next, modifying the totals calculation.

    RPT: r002 25
    
    Reading the requirements for r002. Setting up checkout.rb and checkout_test.rb.
    Resolving the two errors so they are only warnings now. Running reek on checkout.rb
    and ensuring that there is no code smell.
    
    Since we are not modifying checkout_test.rb, not resolving the code smell pointed
    out by reek. Working on setting the rules.

    Did not fully complete step 9. Created the new methods but not working
    correctly. Running into assertion issues and bad comparison.
    
    Description of the task unclear. What does time_log return, time sent by
    print or time calculated by Time.now? Also, messages seperated by 1 second
    when 60 second intervals has been done in the past.

    Complete steps six, seven, eight. This consists of creating the timeInterval
    method which throws an UncommunicativeMethodName warning by reek. Splitting
    the one file to three different files and creating the log array.
    
    One issue that I kept dealing with is the warnings thrown by reek. Many
    I can solve by reading the documentation but some are very ambiguous such as,
    UtilityFunction.

    Completed Step two from the list. Installing reek on windows took a bit longer
    because 'gem install reek' did not work so I had to go and download the
    missing dependancies. After I had reek installed, figuring out the different errors
    and looking up how to fix them took sometime.

    Began by testing the magic_ball exampleto ensure that minitest works correctly.
    After seeing minitest work, I moved count_down to this directory and began modifying
    it to complete step one.
    
    Within the 30 minutes, I was able to complete Step one. Reading the different assertions
    took a bit to figure out which assertion is best.
