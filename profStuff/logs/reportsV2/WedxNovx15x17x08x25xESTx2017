    Began by testing the magic_ball exampleto ensure that minitest works correctly.
    After seeing minitest work, I moved count_down to this directory and began modifying
    it to complete step one.
    
    Within the 30 minutes, I was able to complete Step one. Reading the different assertions
    took a bit to figure out which assertion is best.

    Completed Step two from the list. Installing reek on windows took a bit longer
    because 'gem install reek' did not work so I had to go and download the
    missing dependancies. After I had reek installed, figuring out the different errors
    and looking up how to fix them took sometime.

    method which throws an UncommunicativeMethodName warning by reek. Splitting
    the one file to three different files and creating the log array.
    
    One issue that I kept dealing with is the warnings thrown by reek. Many
    I can solve by reading the documentation but some are very ambiguous such as,
    UtilityFunction.

    Fixed the following reek errors; UtilityFunction
    and UncommunicativeVaribleName. By splitting the justify_line
    function to perform the length checks elsewhere, that fixed the
    UtilityFunction warning.
    
    By changing the for loop to a while loop so that there was
    no extra variable 'i', that fixed the UncommuncativeVariableName
    warning.

    Fixed the following reek warnings; DuplicateMethodCall,
    FeatureEnvy and TooManyStatements.
    
    By creating the space_append method, and moving the while
    loop in there, that fixed the TooManyStatements from the
    justify_line method and the DuplicateMethodCall from
    space_location.next.
    
    By creating an init method where all instance variables
    are created, that fixed the FeatureEnvy warning.

    Fixed the final reek warning; ControlParameter.
    This warning arose from a regex comparison method.
    One can use either '=~' or '.match' to achieve the

    Getting simplecov to install using 'bundle install' took a while.
    This is mainly because I was using windows as my host computer and

    I had to create a Ubuntu VM in order to get simplecov to download and
    install properly.

    Fixed the following reek warnings; TooManyStatements, InstanceVariableAssumption, TooManyInstanceVariables, and IrresponsibleModule.
    TooManyStatements in the following methods; solved_without_matrix? solved? and build_blocks. Fixed by splitting up functions into smaller functions.
    InstanceVariableAssumption ficed by moving those variables into the initialize function of the module.
    TooManyInstanceVariables fixed by using less of them. Reek only allows 5 instance variables.
    IrresponsibleModule fixed by adding descriptions to the module and class.

    Split up the master class of board into two more classes 'WithMatrix' and 'NoMatrix'.
    Both these new classes inherit from 'Board' but now it is easier to keep track which

    Solved the many of the UtilityFunction warnings from reek by splitting up the classes

    Simplecov still covers 100% of the code. Rspec successfully passes all 4 test and
    there are no longer any reek errors.

    Similar to previous tasks, most warnings got solved by splitting large functions

    Contiune to solve mutant warnings. Lowered the count of alive mutatnts to 58 and increased the coverage to 90.76%.
    Instead of accessing the array using [], the .fetch resolved many of the warnings. Also added a raise_error when
    the hi index is greater than the length of the array.

    Continue to work on mutant warnings. Added test cases for lo > hi, hi out of range and nil input.
    Also, change more array access to be called by .fetch. All this resulted in the alive mutants to
    lower to 41 alive.

    Added a new test case that is a three element array and selects the middle element as the pivot point.
    This test case lowered my mutant alive count from 41 to 39. Next going to try and make more test cases
    to lower the alive count where possible.
    At the start was not able to lower alive count more, but just kept trying different cases until it
    occured.

    Added two new test cases;
    1) The input array is inverted and only sorts the last few elements. This results in
    the algorithm choosing a middle pivot point.
    2) The insertionSort function takes an array and only sorts the first couple elements.
    These two cases resulted in lowering the alive count from 39 to 37. Will attempt to see
    if I can resolve anymore mutants.
    At this point it is difficult to come up with test cases that lower the alive count much.

    Created a test case that calls the quicksort function with a negative lo value and
    returns a sorted array. This test case lowered the mutant alive count from 37 to 28.
    Going to continue and attempt to lower the alive count even further.
    
    At this point the test cases are trial and error because the mutant results can be
    very ambiguous by changing constant values.

    Created a test case that calls quicksort with the same hi and lo value. This case
    lowered the alive count from 28 to 24.
    Ran into the issue of understanding the remaining warnings given by mutant. May
    attempt to lower the alive count but believe that not many more can be killed.

    Completed step 10 by calculating the correct time and then asserting to ensure that
    only 1 second had elapsed between messages. Still need to run reek to ensure that
    everything still satisfied.
    
    Understanding the problem took a bit of time and properly calculating the elapsed time.

    Ensured reek was satisfied by all 3 files. In the test file, split up one of the functions because
    it was getting quite large of a function.

    Created a test case that calls quicksort with an array if size 21, lo of 10 and hi of 20.
    This test case lowered the alive count from 24 to 19.
    
    There is not much documentation on mutant so attempting to come up with test cases to
    satisfy the last couple warnings is a bit of a challenge.
