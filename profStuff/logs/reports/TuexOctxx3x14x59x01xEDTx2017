    Began by testing the magic_ball exampleto ensure that minitest works correctly.
    After seeing minitest work, I moved count_down to this directory and began modifying
    it to complete step one.
    
    Within the 30 minutes, I was able to complete Step one. Reading the different assertions
    took a bit to figure out which assertion is best.

    Completed Step two from the list. Installing reek on windows took a bit longer
    because 'gem install reek' did not work so I had to go and download the
    missing dependancies. After I had reek installed, figuring out the different errors
    and looking up how to fix them took sometime.

    Complete steps three, four and five. Understanding the tasks is a bit
    challenging, better clarity would be ideal.

    Complete steps six, seven, eight. This consists of creating the timeInterval
    method which throws an UncommunicativeMethodName warning by reek. Splitting
    the one file to three different files and creating the log array.
    
    One issue that I kept dealing with is the warnings thrown by reek. Many
    I can solve by reading the documentation but some are very ambiguous such as,
    UtilityFunction.

    Did not fully complete step 9. Created the new methods but not working
    correctly. Running into assertion issues and bad comparison.
    
    Description of the task unclear. What does time_log return, time sent by
    print or time calculated by Time.now? Also, messages seperated by 1 second
    when 60 second intervals has been done in the past.

    Reading the requirements for r002. Setting up checkout.rb and checkout_test.rb.
    Resolving the two errors so they are only warnings now. Running reek on checkout.rb
    and ensuring that there is no code smell.
    
    Since we are not modifying checkout_test.rb, not resolving the code smell pointed
    out by reek. Working on setting the rules.

    Modified the hash table to be a nested hash table so it handles the
    discounts differently. Created a Discount class for the specific
    discount per item.
    
    Looking into why my totals variable does not reset on object initialization.
    Next, modifying the totals calculation.

    Fixed the attribute issue between objects. Created a hash that will count
    the number of each item inputted.
    
    Calculating the correct total value is next.
    
    Learning about hash and working with them took a bit of time.

    Solved why certain variables were being overwritten. Learned the difference
    between global variables and instance variables. Modified the hash table
    that keeps track of the BasePrice class and Discount class.
    
    Need to run reek on the modified code to ensure there is no code smell.
    Fixing those will take sometime.

    Modified program to pass all the test cases. Incorrect calculation being
    done.
    
    Learned what attr_reader does and helps so that I do not have to implement
    that function.
    
    Going to run reek and begin fixing the code smell throughout the program.
