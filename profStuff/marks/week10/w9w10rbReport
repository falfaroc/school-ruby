>     Created beancounting.rb with initializer that takes in the string input of the user.
>     Also created/modified the step_definitions to pass in the input to an instance of
>     BeanCounting. Lastly, figuredout how to count the number of occurrances of a character
>     in a string. Will be using that to determine the winners.

>     I had an issue of understanding and using the .split() function. When the input
>     was passed to the steps file, it treated it as an array of characters as opposed
>     to a string. Therefore, to properly split I had to use single quotes for characters.

>     Created a double hash map to split and handle the inputs. Now depending on the guesser and guess
>     for each bean, the value can be retrieved.

>     At the start I was stuck on understanding the problem at hand. Was confusing number of guesses with
>     total value guessed by the contestants. After reading it a couple of times, I was able to figure out
>     my error and calculations. Currently, creating a map to hold the number of beans in the jar and with
>     that I will be able to caluculate the shares.

>     Keeping track of the total_shares and the total_guesses for later calculation. Changed
>     storage of beans count to be a hash map for easy comparison. Properly calucalated the shares
