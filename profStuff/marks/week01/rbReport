    Began by testing the magic_ball exampleto ensure that minitest works correctly.
    After seeing minitest work, I moved count_down to this directory and began modifying
    it to complete step one.
    
    Within the 30 minutes, I was able to complete Step one. Reading the different assertions
    took a bit to figure out which assertion is best.

    Completed Step two from the list. Installing reek on windows took a bit longer
    because 'gem install reek' did not work so I had to go and download the
    missing dependancies. After I had reek installed, figuring out the different errors
    and looking up how to fix them took sometime.

    Complete steps three, four and five. Understanding the tasks is a bit
    challenging, better clarity would be ideal.

    Complete steps six, seven, eight. This consists of creating the timeInterval
    method which throws an UncommunicativeMethodName warning by reek. Splitting
    the one file to three different files and creating the log array.
    
    One issue that I kept dealing with is the warnings thrown by reek. Many
    I can solve by reading the documentation but some are very ambiguous such as,
    UtilityFunction.

    Did not fully complete step 9. Created the new methods but not working
    correctly. Running into assertion issues and bad comparison.
    
    Description of the task unclear. What does time_log return, time sent by
    print or time calculated by Time.now? Also, messages seperated by 1 second
    when 60 second intervals has been done in the past.
