>     
>     Downloaded and added gcd.rb in the r009 folder. Ran cucumber --init to setup the
>     appropriate file structure to run cucumber. Copied the features file into that directory.
>     
>     When I attempted to run cucumber, it did not throw any errors or warnings even though
>     the instructions said it would. Need to look into why it is not throwing any issues.

>     Figured out why cucumber was not detecting the features file. Turns out that before
>     each test you need the 'Scenario:' key word for cucumber to detect it. Without that key
>     word, cucumber just displays 0 scenarios, 0 steps.
>     
>     Next I will be fixing up the scenarios to pass its given steps.

>     Completed step 3. Created gcd_testing.rb in step_definition that handles the structure
>     of the cucumber tests. Also, added the require_relative of gcd.rb in env.rb so that
>     cucumber detects the gcd.rb function.

>     Downloaded prime_factors.rb, initialized the required files for cucumber and
>     copied over the prime.feature file to the correct location.

>     Ran into the issue of cucumber displaying a parser error. Turns out that if

>     
>     Ran into the issue of the first element resulting 0 while the rest were fine.
>     I solved this by stripping the quotations from the string and then converting
>     that into an integer array. It appeared that Ruby would escape the first quotation
>     which then when attempting to split the string, the quotation would try to convert to
>     an integer and thus resulting it to 0.
