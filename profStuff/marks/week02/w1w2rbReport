>     Reading the requirements for r002. Setting up checkout.rb and checkout_test.rb.
>     Resolving the two errors so they are only warnings now. Running reek on checkout.rb
>     and ensuring that there is no code smell.
>     
>     Since we are not modifying checkout_test.rb, not resolving the code smell pointed
>     out by reek. Working on setting the rules.

>     Modified the hash table to be a nested hash table so it handles the
>     discounts differently. Created a Discount class for the specific
>     discount per item.
>     
>     Looking into why my totals variable does not reset on object initialization.
>     Next, modifying the totals calculation.

>     the number of each item inputted.

>     Solved why certain variables were being overwritten. Learned the difference
>     between global variables and instance variables. Modified the hash table
>     that keeps track of the BasePrice class and Discount class.
>     
>     Need to run reek on the modified code to ensure there is no code smell.
>     Fixing those will take sometime.

>     Fixed all the warnings thrown by reek. Seperated the multiple method calls
>     into their own functions.
>     Basically, once the core logic was ironed out, all the test cases ran and
>     passed.
>     
>     Task is done, might continue to clean up code. Will work and try to finish
