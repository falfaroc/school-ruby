>     Getting simplecov to install using 'bundle install' took a while.
>     This is mainly because I was using windows as my host computer and
>     it requires 'make' which windows does not natively has. Therefore,
>     I had to create a Ubuntu VM in order to get simplecov to download and
>     install properly.

>     to 'to' with prefix of 'expect' at each line. Also, enabled
>     'config.raise_errors_for_deprecations' to display all the

>     Completed step 2, 3 and 4. Fixed the depreciation problem prior to reading it
>     so that worked out nicely. To show all the lines have been executed, added
>     a check that player2 won.
>     
>     Attempting step 5 now, fixing the reek issues.

>     Fixed the following reek warnings; TooManyStatements, InstanceVariableAssumption, TooManyInstanceVariables, and IrresponsibleModule.
>     TooManyStatements in the following methods; solved_without_matrix? solved? and build_blocks. Fixed by splitting up functions into smaller functions.
>     InstanceVariableAssumption ficed by moving those variables into the initialize function of the module.
>     TooManyInstanceVariables fixed by using less of them. Reek only allows 5 instance variables.
>     IrresponsibleModule fixed by adding descriptions to the module and class.
