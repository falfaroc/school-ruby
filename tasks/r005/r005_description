r005 is another `ruby task'.  In order to record practice on this task, you 
will need to commit messages whose first line is:
    RPT: r005 time
where time is replaced by a numeric value less than or equal to 30 and
corresponding to the amount of practice time (in minutes) you spent 
since the last such commit on the task r005.  The body of the message will 
tell how far you have gotten with the task so far and what problems, 
if any, you are having completing the task.  Note that these commits 
are not direct communications with the prof, but instead notes in your
practice report which probably won't be read until the practice report is 
marked.  By now you should be familiar with this routine and the various
related wiki presentations, particularly
  A Checklist for Week 2 and on's Practice
and
  On the marking of the first week of practice

This particular task uses rspec and simplecov which were introduced in
r003 and r004, respectively.

Step 1:  From https://github.com/eliotsykes/rspec-katas download
the sudoku validator kata 
   https://github.com/eliotsykes/rspec-katas/tree/master/sudoku-validator
This has both rspec tests and sample solution.

Step 2: Add instrumentation so that simplecov
runs, run the test suite and find that nearly a third of the lines of code
are not covered by the test suite.

Step 3:  Add test case to sudoku_validator_spec.rb so that when you run it 
the program passes and simplecov's report shows all lines of code have been 
executed.

Step 4: Now you can start refactoring this code so that it continues to
pass the test cases, but also gets a clean bill of health from reek.
Also keep an eye on coverage, adding test cases where necessary to cover
new code written during the refactoring
