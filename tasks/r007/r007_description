r007 is another `ruby task'.  In order to record practice on this task, you 
will need to commit messages whose first line is:
    RPT: r007 time
where time is replaced by a numeric value less than or equal to 30 and
corresponding to the amount of practice time (in minutes) you spent 
since the last such commit on the task r007.  The body of the message will 
tell how far you have gotten with the task so far and what problems, 
if any, you are having completing the task.  Note that these commits 
are not direct communications with the prof, but instead notes in your
practice report which probably won't be read until the practice report is 
marked.  By now you should be familiar with this routine and the various
related wiki presentations, particularly
  A Checklist for Week 2 and on's Practice
and
  On the marking of the first week of practice

This particular task uses rspec and simplecov which were introduced in
r003 and r004, respectively.  It brings in a third library, mutant.

Step 1:  From 
   https://github.com/IuliiaKot/quicksort_median_of_three
download quicksort_median_of_three along with its accompanying rspec
test suite.


Step 2: Add instrumentation so that you can run simplecov and check to
see if the test suite covers all the statements of quicksort_median_of_three.rb
If not, add tests to ensure 100% statement coverage.

Step 3: Now we want to consider the quality of the tests by using mutation
testing.  See Notes re eighth class for more details on how to set up and
use mutation testing.  Also useful is the documentation and links at
    https://github.com/mbj/mutant
Add new tests to kill mutants where possible and verify the correctness of
mutants that couldn't be killed.
