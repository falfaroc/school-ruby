r009 is another `ruby task'.  In order to record practice on this task, you 
will need to commit messages whose first line is:
    RPT: r009 time
where time is replaced by a numeric value less than or equal to 30 and
corresponding to the amount of practice time (in minutes) you spent 
since the last such commit on the task r009.  The body of the message will 
tell how far you have gotten with the task so far and what problems, 
if any, you are having completing the task.  Note that these commits 
are not direct communications with the prof, but instead notes in your
practice report which probably won't be read until the practice report is 
marked.  By now you should be familiar with this routine and the various
related wiki presentations, particularly
  A Checklist for Week 2 and on's Practice
and
  On the marking of the first week of practice

This particular task introduces cucumber.  In the notes on the wiki for the
nineth and tenth class, you will find many links to get you started with
cucumber.  For doing this exercise, most of what you need is in

Step 1:  From 
     https://gist.github.com/peterc/1582783
cut and paste the code for gcd.rb into the r009 directory with that name.
This code implements a particular approach to gcd called Stein's algorithm.

Step 2: Create the feature directory structure necessary for running cucumber
into r009 and insert into it a copy of profStuff/sample/gcd.feature .
When you run cucumber, it should complain about my steps not being defined.

Step 3: Guess what.  You get to implement the missing steps so that when
cucumber runs my feature file it tests the gcd.rb code.

Step 4: My feature file is rather tedious.  It would be nicer if I could
group my input/ output values into a table.  Fortunately I can, see
   https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Scenario-Outlines
Restructure the feature file so that it uses this capability (no new
step definitions should be necessary).
