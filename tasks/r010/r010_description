r010 is another `ruby task'.  In order to record practice on this task, you 
will need to commit messages whose first line is:
    RPT: r010 time
where time is replaced by a numeric value less than or equal to 30 and
corresponding to the amount of practice time (in minutes) you spent 
since the last such commit on the task r010.  The body of the message will 
tell how far you have gotten with the task so far and what problems, 
if any, you are having completing the task.  Note that these commits 
are not direct communications with the prof, but instead notes in your
practice report which probably won't be read until the practice report is 
marked.  By now you should be familiar with this routine and the various
related wiki presentations, particularly
  A Checklist for Week 2 and on's Practice
and
  On the marking of the first week of practice

This particular task continues work with cucumber (see r009 for introduction
to cucumber). 

Step 1:  Download the prime factorization program from 
   https://github.com/AaronLasseigne/exercism-answers/tree/master/ruby/prime-factors

Step 2: Create the feature directory structure necessary for running cucumber
into r010 and insert into it a copy of profStuff/sample/prime.feature .
When you run cucumber, it should complain about my steps not being defined.

Step 3: Guess what.  You get to implement the missing steps so that when
cucumber runs my feature file it tests the prime_factors.rb code.  You may
find the following stack overflow entry useful for processing the step:
