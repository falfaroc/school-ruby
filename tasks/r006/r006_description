r006 is another `ruby task'.  In order to record practice on this task, you 
will need to commit messages whose first line is:
    RPT: r006 time
where time is replaced by a numeric value less than or equal to 30 and
corresponding to the amount of practice time (in minutes) you spent 
since the last such commit on the task r006.  The body of the message will 
tell how far you have gotten with the task so far and what problems, 
if any, you are having completing the task.  Note that these commits 
are not direct communications with the prof, but instead notes in your
practice report which probably won't be read until the practice report is 
marked.  By now you should be familiar with this routine and the various
related wiki presentations, particularly
  A Checklist for Week 2 and on's Practice
and
  On the marking of the first week of practice

This particular task uses rspec and simplecov which were introduced in
r003 and r004, respectively.

Step 1:  From 
   https://gist.github.com/jithinabraham/f23652a8bc6ae6e7a6c31f5680da6bc8
cut and past heap_sort.rb, which has the ruby source of a class HeapSort.


Step 2: Add instrumentation so that you can run simplecov and rspec with it
to verify that HeapSort.new([3, 2, 1]).heap_sort returns [1, 2, 3]

Step 3: Create more tests so that simplecov shows 100% coverage of HeapSort.

Step 4: Refactor heap_sort.rb so that reek is happy with it while checking
that your tests pass and that you still have 100% coverage according to
simplecov (adding new tests as necessary).

Step 5: Of course the interesting thing about heapsort is how fast it is.
What I would like to know is does this implementation have a performance
bug or do I have a real n log n sort here.  One way to do this would be
to count the number of `array accesses'.  This should be done without
changing the code of HeapSort at all.  One way is as follows.

Looking at the code, it looks like input is an array, but really input is
just an instance of some class that supports the length, [], and []= methods.
So, I can do a performance check by creating a class ArrayWatcher that 
supports the following five methods:
  initialize: takes an `array' and stores it in an instance variable and
              sets a count instance variable to 0
  length: returns length of the stored array
  []: returns the value stored at the indicated location in the stored array
      and increments the counter.
  []=: sets the value of the stored array at the indicated location in the
       first parameter to the value in the second parameter, and increments
       counter.
  count: return value of internal counter.
This is another situation where Ruby syntax is flexible, letting you define
[](a) and []=(a,b) and then use them as [a] and [a]=b , respectively.

With this, we can write a simple bit of code that tries larger and larger
arrays or random values until it finds the size array such that the number
of array accesses is less than n * sqrt(n) where n is the size of the array
being sorted.  This gives us some indication that it is probably an efficient
sort.

Step 6:  If you have not already done so, add a set of tests that cover
the class ArrayWatcher seperately.  Note these can be run in isolation by
using rspec's tag feature described in
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5069677/how-do-i-run-only-specific-tests-in-rspec

Step 7: Can you do better than this?  That is set up a collection of tests
that not only show that it is O (n * log n) but what the bounding value k is
such that the number of accesses is less than or equal to k * (n * log n)
(the definition of big-O notation 
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation 
).
